##User story:

AS A traveler

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities

SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

##Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city

THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history

THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

##Details:

-My motivation for this project was to better understand how APIs interact and add functionality to pre-existing JavaScript code. 

-As I worked on this assignment, I learned just how pivotal APIs can be when creating more complex websites.

-Through the use of this API, one can search for any city across the globe and see a 5-day, 3-hour forecast.

-I built this project to hone my JavaScript skills as well as familarize myself with APIs, local storage, and so on.
