# Weather-Forecast
## A searchable application with accessible session search history providing current weather and 5-day, 3-hour forecast for cities across the globe, utilizing the HTTP request capability via AJAX, obtainining and parsing JSON weather data from the third-party OpenWeatherMap API.

CSS styling done utilizing Milligram.io minimalist CSS framework.

##Details:

-My motivation for this project was to better understand how APIs interact and add functionality to pre-existing JavaScript code. 

-As I worked on this assignment, I learned just how pivotal APIs can be when creating more complex websites.

-Through the use of this API, one can search for any city across the globe and see a 5-day, 3-hour forecast.

-I built this project to hone my JavaScript skills as well as familarize myself with APIs, local storage, and so on.
